Our last trip we ensured our seats at a play to experience the true Shakespeare feel. It was an "audience choice " performance, so until the clapping finished we didnt know what we were going to see. As it turned out, a Comedy of Errors was delightful, albeit a little confusing, our next door neighbours were fabulous and we could not have had a better night. This has to be a MUST especially for overseas visitors.' },
